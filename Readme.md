## 🧠 Development Journey
This project was built to explore modern frontend architecture and high-end UI design. The initial foundation and scaffolding were rapidly prototyped using Cursor AI, allowing for a massive acceleration in boilerplate generation and layout structuring.

Following the AI-assisted generation, significant manual engineering was done to:

* **Refine the Command Palette's state management and AnimatePresence lifecycle.

* **Debug and perfect complex Flexbox layouts for the AI chat interface across mobile and desktop viewports.

* **Fine-tune Framer Motion variants to prevent layout thrashing.

* **Ensure strict TypeScript safety and Context API optimization.
